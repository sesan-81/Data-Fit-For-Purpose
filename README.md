# Data-Fit-For-Purpose

Based on the analysis conducted on the dataset, I can form a modeling strategy considering the insights gained from the exploration. Here's a suggested modeling strategy based on the observations:
1.	Feature Selection:
Identify Important Features: Review the correlation matrix to identify features that have a significant correlation with the target variable (if available). These features can be strong candidates for inclusion in my predictive model.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values: If there are missing values in important features, consider strategies such as imputation (filling missing values with a calculated statistic) or removal of rows/columns with missing values, depending on the extent of missing data.
Outlier Treatment: Based on the boxplots, I can consider whether to remove outliers or apply transformations to mitigate their impact on the model. Outliers might distort the model, especially in algorithms sensitive to extreme values.
Feature Transformation: If any features exhibit skewness, I consider applying transformations (such as logarithmic or Box-Cox) to make the data more normally distributed, especially if you plan to use algorithms sensitive to feature distribution.
Encoding Categorical Variables: If there are categorical variables (like 'gender' in your case), encode them into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding, depending on the nature of the categorical variable.
Feature Scaling: Scale numerical features if you plan to use algorithms where feature magnitude matters, like gradient-based algorithms (e.g., gradient boosting, neural networks).
3.	Model Selection:
Choose Appropriate Models: Based on the nature of the problem (regression, classification, etc.) and the size of the dataset, select suitable models. For example, linear regression for regression tasks, random forests or gradient boosting for complex non-linear relationships, and logistic regression or decision trees for classification tasks.
Consider Ensemble Methods: Since there is a lack of a clear linear relationship between features and the target, consider ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. They often handle complex relationships well and are less prone to overfitting.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques (such as k-fold cross-validation) to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data. This helps in obtaining a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance and generalizability.
4.	Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on one subset and validate its performance on another unseen subset.
